1.	in "sys_graph::sys_statistics::sys_calc" should change "uint64_t num = rand () % 32768" with something 
	according to input bit widths and ensure that no overflow will occur.
2.	checkup "multiplier" operation for 48 bit width. it perform weirdly.
3.	change operation bit width to from static to dynamic. it means that bit width should only 
	show the input bit width and output bit width should change appropriately.
4.	check the performance of "bit_set" for "adder".
5.	operators should have a method that changes their approximate widths.
